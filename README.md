# Forms-Multi-page-Generator
This is a small application to put address labels on a multipage PDF document.

Marketing came to me looking for a way to put address labels on a massive 
catelog they were printing. They needed a template A and a template B side. 
The marketing team already had the positioning in pixels so this is my proof
of concept turned production app.

Basically what this does is craete an address label of sorts on a page. The 
number of pages is controlled by you. In this case we needed 625 pages with 
address labels on every page except the one listed in the blank pages text box.
